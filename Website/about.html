            <p>roflmaoist is an electronic music project that began as a response to many things. one of them 
                is the general loneliness and alienation endemic to post-industrial society. another is the role my 
                own mental health issues have had in exacerbating that loneliness and alienation
            </p>
            
            <p>
                another is a two-week trip to the united kingdom, manchester specifically. despite not being in "the big city,"
                i was greeted with an open expression of artistic, political, and aesthetic radicalism that i had not yet seen 
                in the united states (at least, not on the left). i was also taken by the many elements of overseas culture that
                borrow elements of american culture - uk electronic music regularly samples american soul singers and rappers, and 
                i overheard a teenager in a record shop owner if he had "heard of playboi carti," calling him
                "a little devious" (imagine liam gallagher saying it, it sounded exactly like that)
            </p>

            <p>
                my music is also a response to a very technological upbringing. I learned to be a voracious consumer through virtually
                uninhibited internet access in my teenage years (as many of us did). This led to a highly consumptive sense of identity - 
                i am not defined by my believes or spiritual value, but instead by what i watch/listen to/read/purchase.
                i am not alone or novel in these observations - the internet's acceleration of our tendency to consume has been discussed
                by people a lot more intelligent than i am. but i don't think the role of music in this phenomenon has been explored sufficiently
            </p>

            <p>
                there is a particular kind of person i imagine will like roflmaoist: the mentally ill but highly intelligent 
                internet-savvy gen-zs/millenials with adderall scripts and enough esoteric knowledge in their head to fill a library.
                enough knowledge that they feel thoroughly alienated from the rest of functioning society. 
                this might be projection though - only time will tell

                ps: to make my political allegiances clear - i am leftist, but not a maoist. nazi punks, you know the rest
            </p>
            <p>
                pps: rofl is pronounced like roflcopter. maoist is just maoist. rofl-maoist. roflmaoist
