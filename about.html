            <p>actually, i am walker, the man behind roflmaoist and the person who coded this website all by himself (shocker).</p>

            <p>roflmaoist is an electronic music project that i started following a two week trip to the uk.
                i was greeted with an open expression of artistic, political, and aesthetic radicalism that i had not yet seen 
                in the united states (at least, not on the left). i was also taken by the many elements of overseas culture that
                borrow elements of american culture - uk electronic music regularly samples american soul singers and rappers, and 
                i overheard a young person in manchester asking a record shop owner if he had "heard of playboi carti," calling him
                "a little devious." roflmaoist also contains elements of j-music, although this isn't by design as much as it is by nostalgia.
                So, in an unintentional sense, roflmaoist is the channeling of non-american interpretations of american music
                back into the american sphere.

                there is a particular kind of person i imagine will like roflmaoist: the mentally ill but highly intelligent 
                internet-savvy gen-zs/millenials with adderall scripts and enough esoteric knowledge in their head to fill a library.
                enough knowledge that they feel thoroughly alienated from the rest of functioning society. 
                this might be projection though - only time will tell.

                ps: to make my political allegiances clear - i am a leftist, but not a maoist. i do tend to agree with mao more than
                marx, in the theoretical at least.
            </p>
            <p>
                pps: rofl is pronounced like roflcopter. maoist is just maoist. rofl-maoist. roflmaoist.
